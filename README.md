STL Extension for Autodesk® Revit®
===========

The STL Extension for use with Autodesk® Revit® is a proof-of-concept project designed to create an STL file from a 3D building information model, thereby enabling easier 3D printing. STL is a popular file format for stereo lithography (3D Printing) used for rapid prototyping and computer aided manufacturing.
 
In the building space, it is used by architects and engineers to build 3D models. This is an add-in for Revit products that provides the ability to export geometric data from Revit to ASCII and Binary STL files.

## General Usage Instructions
Clicking on this application button on the UI, will open up a “Export STL” dialog. In the “General” tab of the “Export STL” dialog, select the file format you want to use. If you want to export link models, check “Include Link Models”. In the “Categories” tab, select the categories in which the models to be exported.
