                "longDesc": "The STL Exporter for use with Autodesk Revit is a proof-of-concept project designed to create an STL file from a 3D building information model, thereby enabling easier 3D printing. STL is a popular file format for stereo lithography (3D Printing) used for rapid prototyping and computer aided manufacturing. In the building space, it is used by architects and engineers to build 3D models. This is an add-in for Revit products that provides the ability to export geometric data from Revit to ASCII and Binary STL files."
